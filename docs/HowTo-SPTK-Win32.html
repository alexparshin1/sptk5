<H1>How to compile SPTK on Windows</H1>
<P style=3D"MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">This HowTo is designed to help you if =
you decide=20
to use Microsoft Visual C++. If you follow these steps (below) &#8211; =
it should be=20
fairly easy.</P>
<OL>
  <LI>
  <P style=3D"MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Download FLTK from <A=20
  href=3D"http://www.fltk.org/" name=3Dfltk>FLTK website</A> and unpack =
it to the=20
  top level directory of any logical disk. Rename FLTK directory to just =
&#8220;fltk&#8221;=20
  (exclude the version number). Compile it by using the FLTK VC++ =
workspace file=20
  (select any project). You can find that file in \fltk\visualc =
directory.</P>
  <LI>
  <P style=3D"MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Optionally, download and install <A=20
  href=3D"http://aspell.net/win32">ASpell for Win32</A> and at least one =

  dictionary for it. Download and unpack aspell-dev to the top level =
directory=20
  of the same logical disk as FLTK. Rename aspell-dev directory to just =
&#8220;aspell&#8221;=20
  (exclude the version number).</P>
  <LI>
  <P style=3D"MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Optionally, but highly recommended, =
install the=20
  ODBC manager and drivers for your favorite database(s). You can get it =
with=20
  the installation of Microsoft Office, or with any of the major SQL =
database=20
  clients.</P>
  <LI>
  <P style=3D"MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Download SPTK from <A=20
  href=3D"http://www.sptk.net/">SPTK website</A> and unpack it to the =
top level=20
  directory of the same logical disk as FLTK. Rename FLTK directory to =
just=20
  &#8220;sptk&#8221; (exclude the version number). In that case you =
don't have to correct=20
  any project files.</P>
  <LI>
  <P style=3D"MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Copy \sptk\sptk\sptk-config.h.win file =
to=20
  \sptk\sptk\sptk-config.h. Edit the file with any editor to define =
options=20
  you'd like to have in SPTK. Options you can change, are named as =
HAVE_*. For=20
  instance, if you don't want ASpell support &#8211; you can change the =
define for it=20
  to 0 like this: <I>#define HAVE_ASPELL 0 </I></P>
  <LI>
  <P style=3D"MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Compile it by using the SPTK VC++ =
workspace file=20
  (selecting any example project). You can find that file in \sptk\VC6=20
  directory.</P>
  <LI>
  <P style=3D"MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The resulting libraries would be =
placed into=20
  \sptk\lib. If you want to create your own project using SPTK, make =
sure you=20
  include fltk and sptk directories to the include path list, and fltk =
and sptk=20
  libraries to link libraries list. As a quick solution, you can copy =
and modify=20
  one of the VC++ project files from \sptk\examples and modify it in any =
test=20
  editor, or directly in Visual Studio.</P>
  <LI>
  <P style=3D"MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">Copy the SPTK themes from =
\sptk\.themes.sptk=20
  into Windows directory, most likely C:\Windows\.themes.sptk.</P>
  <LI>
  <P style=3D"MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">The most important step. Have=20
fun!</P></LI></OL></BODY></HTML>
