This directory contains Sql2Cpp files.
Sql2Cpp generates C++ interface classes for PostgreSQL stored procedures.

In order to run the tests, you have to create default PostgreSQL database
for the current user, and run the command:

psql -f create_test_tables.sql

After that, you can run Sql2Cpp:

perl sql2cpp.pl

The SQL files are located in sql/ sub-directory. Sql2Cpp should generate 
files src/CBook.{h,cpp} and src/CAuthor.{h.cpp}. You can change the generated 
file and class names, file paths, and many other parameters, in configuration 
file sql2cpp.conf.

The default configuration file refers to CRecordSet class. The simplistic
version of this class is provided for your convenience in src/ sub-directory.
