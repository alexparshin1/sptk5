SPTK supports Oracle driver if Oracle client is installed.

Using Oracle client on Linux directly requires building SPTK using old cxx ABI. That option may be selected using ccmake:

cmake .
ccmake .

This also means that the projects that use SPTK will also need to use old cxx ABI.
If that isn't a good option AND you need to use Oracle than you can install OCILib and reconfigure SPTK to use new cxx ABI.

The OCILib can be downloaded here:
